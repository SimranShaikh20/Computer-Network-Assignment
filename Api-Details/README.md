# 🔌 Socket Information Retrieval

## 📌 Overview
This Python script demonstrates the usage of the `socket` module to retrieve essential network-related information. It includes fetching the port number for HTTP over TCP, obtaining the protocol number for TCP, and resolving the IP address of a given hostname (e.g., `google.com`).

## 🚀 Features
- Retrieves the port number for HTTP over TCP.
- Gets the protocol number for TCP.
- Resolves the IP address of a given hostname.
- Handles exceptions for socket errors gracefully.

## 🛠️ Usage
This script is useful for:
- Network debugging and diagnostics.
- Understanding how socket communication works.
- Resolving domain names to IP addresses.

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed (3.x recommended).
2. Copy and save the script as `socket_info.py`.
3. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python socket_info.py
   ```

## ⚡ Where This is Used
- 🔎 **Web Development**: Helps in understanding how servers and clients communicate.
- 🌐 **Network Troubleshooting**: Used to verify service availability and DNS resolution.
- 🖥️ **Cybersecurity**: Can be part of port scanning and network analysis tools.
